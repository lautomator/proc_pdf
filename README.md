This script uses field names and values
from a PDF and passes that information to
an HTML template. The PDF is such that it 
contains fields; the filled fields are
dumped to a text file. This script is 
specifically looking for the the FieldName
and FieldValue properties from the data
dump. Those fields are specific to the 
template and values will be used to populate
the corresponding areas of the HTML template.
